        A streamlined design briefing, created for individuals who hate the
        over-complication of today&apos;s newspapers and magazines. Dip in, dip
        out, access the information you need in an instant, and leave satisfied.
        Good enough for a double dip. Materiality is key to the simplicity of
        dip. No frills, the magazine is printed on simple 140gsm paper,
        championing the real star: the content. With a cover free of any flashy
        print finishes, and crafted from 250gsm cardstock, dip looks and feels
        clean and uncomplicated. Dip prioritises legibility and content above
        all else, but visual interest is not forgotten. The magazine is a
        cataclysm of bright pantone colour and stark black and white images. Dip
        is designed by designers, for designers, so there is a perfect balance
        between strong visual style and legibility.
