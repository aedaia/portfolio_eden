The initial research stage consisted of an in-depth exploration of similar subject matter, both in French and English. A range of different texts were studied to analyse the typographic considerations, and several surprising points were noted: French writers do not use quotation marks, instead, they opt for ‘guillemets’, which require spacing either side; There is always additional spacing around French colons and semi-colons; Some French readers hate an accent on a capital letter (É), whereas some require it. The target audience for Émile Nivedaub was a key focus throughout the research phase of the project. People who would buy this book would not only be interested in Lithography, but design as a whole, which meant that the typography (and typical ‘French’ typographic norms) had to be perfect."),l.a.createElement("br",null)," ",l.a.createElement("br",null)," ",l.a.createElement("br",null)," ",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement(o.a,{as:"h3",size:"medium"},"Design development"),l.a.createElement("p",null,"After researching thoroughly, it was time to begin setting the inner pages of the book. With a specific page size required by the client (224 x 303mm), I quickly developed a grid to maximise flexibility within the design and allow for multiple interesting combinations of text and image. With the grid completed, the work on the inner pages began. A sample of text was used to plan out the combination of typefaces that were appropriately ‘French looking’, but still legible and a pleasure to read. This was discussed at length with the client, but eventually it was decided that a French-style sans serif for headings and a legible serif for body text would be most agreeable, in combination with a legible sans serif for the footnotes and captions.")),l.a.createElement("div",null,l.a.createElement("img",{src:a("KH4T"),alt:"hello"})),l.a.createElement("br",null)," ",l.a.createElement("br",null)," ",l.a.createElement("br",null)," ",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement(i.a,null,l.a.createElement(o.a,{as:"h3",size:"medium"},"Promotional leaflet"),l.a.createElement("p",null,"After the book had been completed, the client requested a promotional leaflet to sell the text to potential stockists.
