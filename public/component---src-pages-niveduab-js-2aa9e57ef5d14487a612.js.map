The initial research stage consisted of an in-depth\n        exploration of similar subject matter, both in French and English. A\n        range of different texts were studied to analyse the typographic\n        considerations, and several surprising points were noted: French writers\n        do not use quotation marks, instead, they opt for ‘guillemets’, which\n        require spacing either side; There is always additional spacing around\n        French colons and semi-colons; Some French readers hate an accent on a\n        capital letter (É), whereas some require it. The target audience for\n        Émile Nivedaub was a key focus throughout the research phase of the\n        project. People who would buy this book would not only be interested in\n        Lithography, but design as a whole, which meant that the typography (and\n        typical ‘French’ typographic norms) had to be perfect.\n      </p>\n      <br></br> <br></br> <br></br> <br></br>\n      <Title as=\"h3\" size=\"medium\">\n        Design development\n      </Title>\n      <p>\n        After researching thoroughly, it was time to begin setting the inner\n        pages of the book. With a specific page size required by the client (224\n        x 303mm), I quickly developed a grid to maximise flexibility within the\n        design and allow for multiple interesting combinations of text and\n        image. With the grid completed, the work on the inner pages began. A\n        sample of text was used to plan out the combination of typefaces that\n        were appropriately ‘French looking’, but still legible and a pleasure to\n        read. This was discussed at length with the client, but eventually it\n        was decided that a French-style sans serif for headings and a legible\n        serif for body text would be most agreeable, in combination with a\n        legible sans serif for the footnotes and captions.\n      </p>\n    </Box>\n  <div>\n    <img src={require('../images/grid.png')} alt=\"hello\" />\n  </div>\n\n    <br></br> <br></br> <br></br> <br></br>\n    <Box>\n      <Title as=\"h3\" size=\"medium\">\n        Promotional leaflet\n      </Title>\n      <p>\n        After the book had been completed, the client requested a promotional\n        leaflet to sell the text to potential stockists. It was imperative that\n        the leaflet encompassed the look and feel of the book, as well as\n        highlighting some of the most visually effective pages. The client and I\n        worked together to select four spreads that we thought would give the\n        appropriate flavour of the book. From there, it was simple to replicate\n        the style of the book to produce an effective leaflet, by carrying over\n        key colours and typeface choices.\n      </p>\n    </Box>\n    <iframe\n      title=\"processFile\"\n      width=\"100%\"\n      height=\"500px\"\n      src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lPgmvbWGNwhU2ldqDAKgHGXhOIRvg8Mu/preview\"\n    ></iframe>\n    <Footer />\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nNiveduab.propTypes = {\n  data: PropTypes.object.isRequired,\n};\n\nexport default Niveduab;\n\nexport const query = graphql`\n  query niveduabQuery {\n    nivJson {\n      title\n      content {\n        childMarkdownRemark {\n          html\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`;\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/niv2-aa334bf599f28442636cb625e6b464b8.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/niv1-71f4f5e4360a40dd1d5b24b9bd999b9f.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
